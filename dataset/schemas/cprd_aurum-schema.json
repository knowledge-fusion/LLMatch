Information on identifying associated problems, the significance of the problem, and its expected duration can be found in this table. GPs may use \u2018problems\u2019 to manage chronic conditions as it would allow them to group clinical events (including drug prescriptions, measurements, symptom recording) by problem rather than chronologically. To obtain the full problem record (including the clinical code for the problem), problems should be linked to the Observation file using the observation identifier (obsid).",
